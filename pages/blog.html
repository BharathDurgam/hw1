    <b>Okay, lets talk about a movie I watched long time ago. Tha movie name is Predestination.
        The story revolves around 3 main characters that shows in three different timelines. the story drives you
        crazy as it deep dives into it. Sometimes we thinks to get a chance to change our fate, change the past.
        But can we really do that with time travel?? This excerpt captures the essence of the film's exploration of time
        travel and the manipulation of destiny. if you wanna know whether we can change our destiny with time travel, I
        recommend watching this film.
